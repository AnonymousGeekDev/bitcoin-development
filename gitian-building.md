# Gitian Building

Last updated: September 7, 2021

*This is based on fanquake's
[gitian-building](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/blob/master/gitian-building/README.md),
a resource I began updating in January 2020 with info and changes that were
helpful when using it for the first time. Since then, this is updated
regularly.*

----

If you have already set up your environment for gitian builds, you can skip
directly to [Make Base VM for Gitian Building](#make-base-vm-for-gitian-building) below.

----

Bitcoin Core releases are [reproducibly built](https://reproducible-builds.org)
using [Gitian Builder](https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder).

Gitian is the deterministic build process that is used to build the Bitcoin Core
executables. It provides a way to be reasonably sure that the executables are
really built from the git source. It also makes sure that the same, tested
dependencies are used and statically built into the executable.

Multiple developers build the source code by following a specific descriptor
("recipe"), cryptographically sign the result, and upload the resulting
signature. These results are compared and only if they match, the build is
accepted and provided for download.

More independent Gitian builders are needed, which is why this guide exists. It
is preferred you follow the steps yourself instead of using someone else's VM
image to avoid "contaminating" the build.

For further information, the Bitcoin Core "Gitian building" documentation is at
https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building.md


## Initial Dependencies

This is a simplified version of the dependencies documentation in
https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder#prerequisites -- don't hesitate to
refer to it for further info or if you get stuck.

### Linux

If `coreutils` or `ruby` is already included in your distribution, remove it from this
line:

```bash
sudo apt install apt-cacher-ng coreutils ruby
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install coreutils ruby
```

Gitian-builder needs `sha256sum`, which doesn't exist on macOS.

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/gsha256sum /usr/local/bin/sha256sum
```

```bash
brew cask install docker && brew link docker
```

### Docker info for all platforms

- To install Docker, see the information for your platform here: [Docker Engine
  overview](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
- For the [build script](#build-unsigned-sigs) below to function, Linux users
  may need to [allow Docker to run as a non-root
  user](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).
- Once Docker is installed, run it at least once (e.g. with `docker run
  hello-world` or by opening the app) so Docker can request and set up the
  necessary permissions.
- You might want to give Docker access to more CPUs, RAM, etc. This can be done
  by going to `Preferences -> Advanced` in the app and allocating as required.


## Initial Setup

```bash
mkdir gitian-building
pushd gitian-building
```

Fork and clone a copy of the
[gitian.sigs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs) repository.

```bash
# After forking https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs on GitHub
git clone git@github.com:your_github_username/gitian.sigs.git
```

Clone the other required repositories.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs.git # sigs for macOS and Windows only
```

Download the gitian inputs/dependencies into gitian-builder.
```bash
pushd gitian-builder
make -C ../bitcoin/depends download SOURCES_PATH=`pwd`/cache/common
mkdir -p inputs
wget -P inputs https://bitcoincore.org/cfields/osslsigncode-Backports-to-1.7.1.patch
wget -O inputs/osslsigncode-2.0.tar.gz https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode/archive/2.0.tar.gz
wget -P inputs https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/6175295/osslsigncode-1.7.1.tar.gz
wget -P inputs https://bitcoincore.org/depends-sources/sdks/Xcode-11.3.1-11C505-extracted-SDK-with-libcxx-headers.tar.gz
wget iP inputs https://bitcoincore.org/depends-sources/sdks/Xcode-12.1-12A7403-extracted-SDK-with-libcxx-headers.tar.gz
```

If building gitian for Bitcoin Core 0.20.x on macOS, you'll need:
```
wget -P inputs https://bitcoincore.org/depends-sources/sdks/MacOSX10.14.sdk.tar.gz
```

If building gitian for Bitcoin Core 0.19.x on macOS, you'll need:
```
wget -P inputs https://bitcoincore.org/depends-sources/sdks/MacOSX10.11.sdk.tar.gz
```

Exit when you're done with the downloads.
```
popd
```

## Make Base VM for Gitian Building

```bash
pushd gitian-builder
git pull # pull any updates
bin/make-base-vm --suite bionic --arch amd64 --docker
popd
```

If you encounter an error about connection timeouts and are running a firewall
like UFW, you may need to open port 3142, which is required for the
`apt-cacher-ng` web server:

```bash
ufw allow 3142/tcp
ufw reload
```

## Set up and check out the branches to build

You can run the following `git tag` command from within your local bitcoin
repository to see the Bitcoin Core release tags and descriptions, ordered by
most recent last.

```bash
pushd bitcoin
git tag -n | sort -V
popd
```

Update the version and signer values with the version to build and your username.

```bash
export VERSION=0.20.2rc3
export SIGNER=your_username
export USE_DOCKER=1

pushd bitcoin
git checkout v$VERSION
popd
```

## Build Unsigned Sigs

Since we'll be creating a PR to the `gitian.sigs` repo, make a new branch off master:

```bash
pushd gitian.sigs
git checkout -b $SIGNER-$VERSION-unsigned master
popd
```

All of the instructions in this section are to be run from within the
`gitian-builder` directory:

```
pushd gitian-builder
```

#### Intro

The first time `depends` is built for a new version, it can take a *long* time,
as
[dependencies](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/depends/packages)
are being built for all architectures and operating systems. Subsequent builds
will be much faster, as only Bitcoin Core is being compiled.

If you encounter any errors, it may be helpful to restart the base VM, or more
rarely, delete the cache in `gitian-builder/cache` and rebuild the depends:

```bash
# Don't do these unless you need to, because it takes much more time.
rm -r cache
make -C ../bitcoin/depends download SOURCES_PATH=`pwd`/cache/common
```

Follow build progress from the `gitian-builder` directory root using:

```bash
tail -f var/install.log # Setup
tail -f var/build.log # Building dependencies and Bitcoin Core
```

### Now, on to building the unsigned sigs

You would normally run all three of these (Linux, Windows, and macOS) and submit
the results in one PR.

Adjust `num-make` (number of cores, like for `make -j`) and `memory` (RAM) as
needed below. For instance, I have four cores and add one for the `num_make`
value.

The first build will be slow. The subsequent ones will go faster.

#### Linux

```bash
bin/gbuild --num-make 5 --memory 12000 --commit bitcoin=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-linux --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-*.tar.gz build/out/src/bitcoin-*.tar.gz ../
```

#### Windows

```bash
bin/gbuild --num-make 5 --memory 12000 --commit bitcoin=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-win-unsigned --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-*-win-unsigned.tar.gz inputs/bitcoin-win-unsigned.tar.gz
mv build/out/bitcoin-*.zip build/out/bitcoin-*.exe ../
```

#### macOS

```bash
bin/gbuild --num-make 5 --memory 12000 --commit bitcoin=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-osx-unsigned --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-*-osx-unsigned.tar.gz inputs/bitcoin-osx-unsigned.tar.gz
mv build/out/bitcoin-*.tar.gz build/out/bitcoin-*.dmg ../
```

```
popd
```

## Commit Unsigned Sigs

```bash
pushd gitian.sigs
git add .
git commit -m "$SIGNER $VERSION unsigned"
git push -u origin $SIGNER-$VERSION-unsigned
popd
```

Go to https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs and open a PR from that
commit. Done üçª


## Build Signed Sigs

Signed signatures can be built once the `detached sigs` are available in the
[detached-sigs
repo](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs/). They are often
pushed a day or so after the release is tagged and announced on the
#bitcoin-core-dev IRC channel with a message like "22.0.0 detached signatures
are up and tagged."

```bash
pushd bitcoin-detached-sigs
git pull # pull new detached signatures
popd
```

You would normally run both of these (macOS and Windows) and submit the results
in one PR. These build far faster than the builds for the unsigned signatures --
within a minute or so, or even a few seconds.

Since we'll be creating a PR to the `gitian.sigs` repo, make a new branch off master:

```bash
pushd gitian.sigs
git checkout -b $SIGNER-$VERSION-signed master
popd
```

Then navigate to `gitian-builder`

```
pushd gitian-builder
```

#### macOS

```bash
bin/gbuild -i --commit signature=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx-signer.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-osx-signed --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx-signer.yml
bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs/ -r ${VERSION}-osx-signed ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx-signer.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-osx-signed.dmg ../bitcoin-${VERSION}-osx.dmg
```

#### Windows

```bash
bin/gbuild -i --commit signature=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-win-signed --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml
bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs/ -r ${VERSION}-win-signed ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-*win64-setup.exe ../bitcoin-${VERSION}-win64-setup.exe
```

```
popd
```

## Commit Signed Sigs

```bash
pushd gitian.sigs
git add .
git commit -m "$SIGNER $VERSION signed"
git push -u origin $SIGNER-$VERSION-signed
popd
```

Go to https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs and open a PR from that
commit. Done üçª


## One-off builds

You can invoke one-off builds using:

```bash
pushd gitian-builder

env USE_DOCKER=1 ./bin/gbuild -j8 -m 6000 \
--commit bitcoin=79218eae27f62e246d52dc6cda4e8846293e1c8e \
--url bitcoin=https://github.com/fanquake/bitcoin.git \
path/to/bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
```

Useful for testing PRs like [#17787](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17787).
